Subo is the command-line tool for working with the Suborbital Extension Engine (SE2). Subo is used to build SE2 plugins, generate new projects and config files, and is also our mascot üêº.

**You do not need to install language-specific tools to get started with SE2 and Subo!** A Docker toolchain is supported (see below) that can build your SE2 plugins without needing to install language toolchains.

## Install Subo[](#install-subo "Direct link to heading")

The `subo` tool supports JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, and Go on the following platforms and operating systems:

| x86\_64 | arm64 |    |
| ------- | ----- | -- |
| Mac     | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ  |
| Linux   | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ  |
| Windows | üö´    | üö´ |

### macOS (Homebrew)[](#macos-homebrew "Direct link to heading")

If you're on Mac (M1 or Intel), the easiest way to install is via `brew`:

```bash
brew tap suborbital/subo
brew install subo

```

### Install from source (requires Go)[](#install-from-source-requires-go "Direct link to heading")

If you use Linux or otherwise prefer to build from source, simply clone this repository or download a [source code release](https://github.com/suborbital/subo/releases/latest) archive and run:

```bash
make subo

```

This will install `subo` into your GOPATH (`$HOME/go/bin/subo` by default) which you may need to add to your shell's `$PATH` variable.

Subo does not have official support for Windows.

### Verify installation[](#verify-installation "Direct link to heading")

Verify subo was installed:

```
subo --help

```

## Upgrade Subo[](#upgrade-subo "Direct link to heading")

If you installed Subo through Homebrew, run the command below to upgrade:

```
brew upgrade subo

```

If you installed Subo from source, you can upgrade by building/installing the new binary on top of the old one.

## Builders[](#builders "Direct link to heading")

This repo contains builders for the various languages supported by SE2 plugins. A builder is a Docker image that can build SE2 plugins into Wasm plugins, and is used internally by `subo` to build your code.
